1. Trade Secret Status

The TQNN Core Engine and its internal mechanisms are protected as trade secrets.
This includes, but is not limited to:

Tubulin substrate architecture

Spiral entanglement systems

GHZ cobordism circuits

Internal parity, inference, and qualia models

Runtime decision graphs

Substrate training pipelines

Any unpublished or obfuscated source code

Any compiled runtime

Any internal algorithmic or cryptographic logic

Any latent state or execution outputs not publicly exposed

Any internal weights, embeddings, or quantum-inspired structures


Any disclosure, reproduction, or derivation of these mechanisms constitutes misappropriation of trade secrets under applicable law.


---

2. Rights Not Granted

No rights are granted to:

Copy, share, disclose, or redistribute Core components

Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract internal mechanisms

Probe, fingerprint, or analyze the Core Engine

Train competing systems or models using TQNN outputs

Use outputs to approximate, emulate, or replicate the Core

Recreate or derive the TQNN substrate architecture

Use the Core for derivative models (including AGI or inference engines)

Build commercial competitors based on Core behavior

Transfer access or sublicensing without written permission


Access to the API does not grant any rights to the Core Engine or its internal logic.


---

3. Permitted Access

The Core Engine may only be accessed through:

Licensed API gateways

Authorized runtimes

Signed enterprise agreements


No other use is permitted.


---

4. Inference Protection

The following activities are strictly prohibited:

Model distillation

Behavioral emulation

Surrogate model training

Output-to-model replication

Synthetic dataset reconstruction

Gradient or state extraction

Fingerprinting or adversarial probing

Dataset cloning using TQNN outputs

“Teacher model” mimicry

API wrapping to create derivative inference engines


Any attempt to derive or emulate internal state logic is unauthorized use.


---

5. Unauthorized Use

Unauthorized access, reproduction, or disclosure constitutes:

Breach of contract

Misappropriation of trade secrets

Intellectual property infringement

Commercial damages under applicable law


Violations may result in:

Account suspension

API termination

Enterprise contract termination

Legal action

Injunctive relief

Claims for financial damages



---

6. Survivability

All obligations under this license survive:

Account or runtime termination

Contract expiration

API access revocation

Project discontinuation
